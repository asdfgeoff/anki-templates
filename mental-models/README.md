# Anki template for mental models



## What is it

A note type called _Concept_ which contains five fields: name, description, visual, implication, drawbacks.  I wrote a blog post [here](https://geoffruddock.com/mental-models-with-anki/) which explains the motivation behind this template.

## Requirements

This template only works for Anki 2.1, it will not work on Anki 2.0.



## How to install

The best way to start using it is to download the `.apkg` file and import it into your Anki collection. Importing the deck will automatically import the note type and the necessary CSS and JavaSript files. The deck itself can be deleted—it just includes a sample of 30 flashcards using the note type.



## Just curious?

You can inspect the CSS and JavaScript files. I also included a sample of the HTML template for the front and back of a single card. The actual note type involves six of these front–back pairs, but they are nearly identical, with the exception of different fields being blurred on the front side.
